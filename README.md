# Phenakistoscope Project

This project is a digital recreation of a phenakistoscope, a historical animation device that creates the illusion of motion from a sequence of static images. The setup involves running the project to view the animation once it's rendered.

## How to Run the Project

To view the phenakistoscope animation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone [repository URL]`.

2. **Open the Project Folder:**
   - Navigate to the project folder using your file explorer.

3. **Open in Visual Studio Code:**
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server" (if you have the Live Server extension installed). Alternatively, you can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

## Viewing the Phenakistoscope Animation

Once the project is running, the phenakistoscope animation will start automatically upon opening. There are no additional controls or interactions needed. Simply observe the sequence of images to experience the illusion of motion.

## Features

- **Historical Recreation:**
  - The project faithfully recreates the phenakistoscope's animation effect using digital methods.
  - It demonstrates the principle of persistence of vision, where a rapid succession of slightly different images creates the perception of continuous motion.

## Notes

- This project was created as part of a course assignment or personal exploration.
- Contributions and feedback are welcome through pull requests and issues on GitHub.
